## 1. Overview

Cryptocurrency markets are dynamic, and predicting their trends is crucial for investors. In this project, I leverage unsupervised learning, specifically K-Means clustering, to predict cryptocurrency trends based on 24-hour or 7-day price changes. The project involves data preprocessing, feature scaling, cluster analysis, and visualisation of the results.

## 2. Files and Directories

- `crypto_market_data.csv`: Original dataset.
- `Crypto_Clustering.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for cryptocurrency clustering.

## 3. Project Development Stages

i. **Data Loading and Exploration:**
   - Load cryptocurrency market data from `crypto_market_data.csv`.
   - Explore and plot summary statistics to understand the data.

ii. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Use `StandardScaler()` from scikit-learn to normalize the data.
   - Create a DataFrame with scaled data, setting "coin_id" as the index.

iii. **Cluster Analysis - Original Data:**
   - Apply the elbow method to find optimal clusters (k).
   - Cluster cryptocurrencies using K-Means with the best k value.
   - Visualize the clusters using an interactive scatter plot with hvPlot.

iv. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):**
   - Perform PCA on the original scaled data to reduce features to three principal components.
   - Evaluate explained variance to understand information retention.

v. **Cluster Analysis - PCA Data:**
   - Apply the elbow method to find the optimal k for PCA data.
   - Cluster cryptocurrencies using K-Means on PCA data.
   - Visualize the results using an interactive scatter plot.

## 9. Summary

The project uses unsupervised learning techniques to cluster cryptocurrencies based on price changes. Two approaches are explored: clustering on original data and clustering after dimensionality reduction using PCA. The results are visualized for comparison, providing insights into the impact of feature reduction on clustering.
